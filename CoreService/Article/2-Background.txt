In this section, we present related works. There are not lots of work done related to interoperability of different systems based on different middleware or message brokers. 
However, there some works done for the interoperability problem on different domains. In [1] authors stated that increasing number and diversity of the devices used in the IoT domain 
arises the problem of interoperability, where IoT should be able to connect all devices through various data protocols. They propose a middleware capable of supporting 
interoperability by providing a multi-protocol gateway between COAP, MQTT, and WebSocket.They developed a system in which two different sensor exposes its data using different 
communication protocols, one using COAP and other using MQTT. Their proposed system is getting data from these two sensors with COAP and MQTT and publishing these data to a web 
application which uses WebSocket as communication protocol. Their proposed middleware solution is responsible for handling all of these communication protocols to get sensor data and 
give data to web application. The results of this system for data transmission, either from sensors or MQTT COAP has a success rate above 90%, the average delivery of data from 
sensors COAP and MQTT below 1 second, for packet loss rate varied between 0%-25%.
